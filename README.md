# Color Spectrum Generator

This is a color spectrum generator built using React and CSS. It allows users to input color by name or hexadecimal value and renders a spectrum of colors from white to black based on the input color.<br>

**How it Works**

The color spectrum generator takes user input in the form of a color value and uses React components to dynamically generate a spectrum of colors. The spectrum starts with the user's input color and gradually transitions to lighter shades of the color, eventually reaching white. Similarly, it transitions to darker shades of color until it reaches black.
